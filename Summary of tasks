Here's a comprehensive summary of the tasks performed by the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application:

JSON Document Processing

Loads a JSON file using LangChain's JSONLoader
Converts JSON documents into a format suitable for vector embedding
Allows flexible extraction of text content and metadata from JSON files


Vector Store Creation

Uses ChromaDB to create a persistent vector collection
Utilizes Ollama's nomic-embed-text model for generating embeddings
Converts document text into vector representations
Stores documents with unique identifiers and metadata


Semantic Search Capabilities

Enables querying the vector collection using natural language prompts
Retrieves the most relevant documents based on semantic similarity
Supports flexible search across the entire document corpus


Document Reranking

Employs a cross-encoder (MS MARCO MiniLM) to further refine document relevance
Selects top 3 most relevant documents based on the query
Improves search result accuracy beyond simple vector similarity


Generative Question-Answering

Uses an LLM (Llama 3.2) to generate answers based on retrieved context
Applies a system prompt to guide the model in providing comprehensive, context-based responses
Streams the generated response in real-time


User Interface Features

Provides a Streamlit-based web interface
Allows JSON file processing with a single button click
Enables users to ask questions about the uploaded documents
Displays retrieved documents and their relevance scores
Handles error scenarios and provides user feedback


Persistence and Reusability

Creates a persistent ChromaDB collection
Allows reprocessing and updating of the document index
Supports multiple runs and document queries without re-embedding



The application essentially creates an intelligent, context-aware question-answering system that can extract and provide insights from JSON-formatted documents using advanced AI techniques.
